# Studio Lite

##Sidebar
Create a visually stunning sidebar by uploading a cover image, or forgo it altogether for a minimal, clean white background. You can also swap out your text-based blog title for a logo image.

## Sidebar custom links
You can easily add custom links to the Studio Lite sidebar. To do so, open up `/partials/custom-links.hbs`. Contained in that file are detailed instructions and an example link to get you started.

## Disqus Commenting
Studio Lite supports Disqus commenting on the post and static page templates. To enable Disqus, simply locate the disabled code at the bottom of "post.hbs" and remove the html comments (`<!--` and `-->`), as well as replacing DISQUS SHORTNAME with your unique Disqus shortname.

##Google Analytics
Studio Lite includes built-in support for Google Analytics tracking. To enable this feature, open your default.hbs file, remove the comments surrounding the Google Analytics script, and replace "TRACKING ID" with your personal Google Analytics tracking code.

## Social media links
You can easily add social links to the Studio Lite sidebar. To do so, open up `/partials/social-links.hbs`. Contained in that file are detailed instructions and example links to get you started.

##Supported Social Platforms

##Support
We've been making Tumblr themes since 2009. Truth to be told, we wouldn't still be afloat had we not acknowledged, early on, that each individual customer is important. Exceptional, human customer support matters to us a great deal.

Each one of our themes comes fully backed by our dedicated support team (all of us). We're good people, with real faces, and we like what we do. We've also created a help centre so you can get help at any hour. Send us an [email](mailto:support@pixelunion.net) or [tweet at us](http://twitter.com/pixelunion) during office hours (we're in PST!).

We're always happy to answer questions. Not sure what theme is best? Looking for a particular feature? [Get in touch](mailto:support@pixelunion.net).
